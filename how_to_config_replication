1. Prepare two machines and install uv on both of them(please do both for step 2-4 too).
2. Copy repsys and repconfig under sample account XDEMO to $UVHOME
3. Edit repsys under $UVHOME: 
	Change "pub_hostname_or_ip" to your real hostname or IP of the publisher machine.
	Change "sub_hostname_or_ip" to your real hostname or IP of the subscriber machine.
4. Restart uv.
Now you can run "uv_repadmin report" to verify if the publisher and subscriber are in synchronized status.

Run below steps only on the publisher to experience the new feature replication of sequentail I/O in UV11.3.2
5. Go to sample account XDEMO
6. Run below commands 
   uv "BASIC BP WRITESEQ"
   uv "BASIC BP WRITESEQ_BUF"
